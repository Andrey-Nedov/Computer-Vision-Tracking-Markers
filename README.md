# Tasks

- Develop an application for receiving an image from a video camera, a video file or an image file using the OpenCV library (OpenCVSharp);
- Implement the function of entering parameters and the position of the camera relative to the center of the robot support and the function of loading the position of markers (mesh templates);
- Implement the functions of object contour analysis and selection of candidates for navigation markers (mesh patterns);
- Implement the function of detecting markers and calculating their position relative to the camera;
